# 3D-Printed Enclosure

The 3D-printed enclosure is designed to house the Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi Camera Module, push button, relay module, speaker, microphone and USB power supply. The enclosure is designed to be easy to assemble and disassemble, so you can easily access the components inside. Each component is mounted on the faceplate of the enclosure, which is then attached to the wall mount with set screws. The wall mount can be attached to the wall with screws and the cables can be routed through the available openings in the enclosure.

Since the enclosure is designed to be outdoor for all if not most of its life, it is important to use a material that is weatherproof and UV-resistant. The enclosure is designed to be 3D-printed in ABS or PETG, which are both suitable for outdoor use. The enclosure is also designed to be sealed with silicone sealant to prevent water ingress.
